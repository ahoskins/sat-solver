**backtracking SAT solver**

I was taking a course on Algorithms &mdash; learning about SAT solvers, amazed and curious how they're optimizated.  The easiest optimization is
to backtrack the solution search tree, which is what this implementation does.  There is a lot of
[literature](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/gomes/papers/SATSolvers-KR-book-draft-07.pdf) on other techniques.  

This solver is a very readable implemention of a [backtracking SAT solver](http://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~hayward/204/jem/coping.html#sat) written in JavaScript (ES6).
